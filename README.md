OVERVIEW:
AI-Agent Lab is a modular research environment for exploring the design, coordination, and deployment of multi-agent AI systems that process, summarize, and semantically reason over documents. Inspired by the vision of human-AI symbiosis, this project investigates how intelligent agents can serve as research assistants, knowledge organizers, and collaborators for long-term truth-seeking workflows.

The goal is to build a truth-oriented, document-aware, multi-agent system that:

Handles documents of diverse formats (PDFs, text files, etc.)

Performs semantic search, summarization, and Q&A

Supports conversational, memory-aware threads

Enables composable agent pipelines for reasoning and collaboration


FEATURES (Work in Progress):
Thread Agent: Processes user queries and maintains stateful context via a directory-based memory system (data/threads/)

Gradio Frontend: Intuitive UI for uploading, summarizing, and querying documents

Semantic Search: Uses FAISS + SentenceTransformers to embed and retrieve relevant information

Agent Modularization: Agents are designed for plug-and-play interaction across tasks (summarization, search, dialogue)

Configurable Paths: Robust path management ensures clean file structure and reusability


USE CASES:
Personal research assistant for literature review

AI-powered document navigator for analysts and policy researchers

Framework for testing modular AI collaboration and memory systems

Prototyping AI workflows with persistent context


PHILOSOPHY:
This lab aligns with the belief that AI should enhance human epistemic capacity, not distort it. The agents in this system are built to augment deep understanding, reduce cognitive overload, and support transparency in knowledge processes.

This also serves as a sandbox to work with local AI models and test capabilities
