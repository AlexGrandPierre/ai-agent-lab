### Response
Bullet points summarizing the peer advisor feedback guide:

* Max was overall happy with the essay and agreed that more time should be spent explaining Protagoras' dictum better
* Alex's argument is cohesive and flows well, but one sentence or two could be added to explain Protagoras' dictum for clarity
* The examples used are cogent and work well in the context of the SAL
* Max did not have too many edits, and Alex's organization is good with multiple transition sentences and clear prose

Two-sentence analysis:
Alex's essay presents a cohesive argument that effectively uses examples to demonstrate the absurdity of the idea of multiple truths. While Max had some minor edits, Alex's overall organization and use of language is strong, making for a well-written and convincing SAL.
