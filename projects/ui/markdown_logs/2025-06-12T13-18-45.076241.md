### Response
1. Alexandre Grand'Pierre proposes a reconceptualization of belief justification, arguing that any normative model must accurately reflect the cognitive realities of its subjects.
2. He introduces Universal Epistemic Partiality (UEP), a framework that incorporates both epistemic and non-epistemic influences on human belief formation to provide a more accurate account of belief justification and rationality.
3. Non-epistemic influence primarily manifests as cognitive impulses or expressions of fundamental physiological needs, such as loyalty, anxiety, confirmation bias, and emotional attachment.
4. Neuroscientific research links these concepts to evolutionary traits related to survival, revealing that human cognition is significantly shaped by factors promoting survival on Earth.
5. The author argues that evidentialism, as currently conceived, fails to account for non-epistemic factors and presents a misleading image of human objectivity and rationality.

Analysis: Alexandre Grand'Pierre challenges the dominant view of evidence-based belief justification (evidentialism) by proposing Universal Epistemic Partiality (UEP), a framework that incorporates both epistemic and non-epistemic influences on human belief formation. He argues that evidentialism overlooks the impact of physiological needs and cognitive processes on reasoning, which is crucial for constructing a sound and relevant normative model of belief justification and rationality.
