### Response
* Title: Should We Leave Sweatshops Be? by Alexandre Grand'Pierre
* Published on 04/22/2024
* Main Argument: Jessica Flanigan argues against regulating sweatshops because it would violate workers' rights.
* Key Points of the Choice Argument:
   + Regulations infringe on workers’ right to make informed decisions (minimum wage, maximum hours, workplace health and safety requirements)
   + These universal standards could unintentionally harm vulnerable members of society.
   + Example given: an individual who moves into a city with the goal of providing for their family by working as much as they can for four months out of the year would be adversely affected by regulations on maximum work hours and minimum wages.
* Key Points of the Unacceptable Alternatives Argument:
   + Imposing regulations to mitigate unagreed occupational conditions benefits all workers because the conditions are unagreed upon. However, many workers in sweatshops agree to the occupational conditions associated with the job.
   + Flanigan argues it would be impermissible to infringe on workers’ decisions by deciding what is best for them through regulation.
* The paper aims to reconstruct and evaluate Flanigan's Choice Argument and Unacceptable Alternatives Argument in relation to the issue of sweatshop regulations.

Analysis:
The author of this document presents Jessica Flanigan's argument against regulating sweatshops, emphasizing that such regulations would infringe on workers' rights to make informed decisions. The argument hinges on the idea that while regulations may aim to address consumer/employee concerns, business concerns, and overall market concerns, they could also unintentionally harm vulnerable members of society. The author also highlights Flanigan's viewpoint that it is impermissible to infringe on workers’ decisions by deciding what is best for them through regulation. However, the argument fails to consider the broader societal impact of sweatshops and the potential long-term harm they may cause to workers due to poor working conditions, low wages, and long work hours. The author's analysis leaves room for debate about whether the short-term economic benefits outweigh the long-term detrimental effects on workers and society as a whole.
