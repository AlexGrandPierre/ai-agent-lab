### Response
Summary: The document describes the film "Timbuktu" directed by Abderrahmane Sissako. The film is set in a small town in Mali and follows the daily life of its inhabitants before and after a group of Islamic fighters seize control. The film explores themes of conflict, control, and resolution through multiple narratives, introducing the audience to the town and its new militant inhabitants. The jihadists have completely upended the normal way of living by enacting strict new rules, speaking different languages, and patrolling the area with large assault rifles at the ready. Early on, the audience is introduced to Kidane, a herdsman, and his lost cow, which seems to set the stage for how the rest of the movie will follow, hinting at themes of fear, control, and death.

Analysis: "Timbuktu" is a film that explores the devastating effects of conflict on innocent civilians in a small town in Mali. Through the use of plot development, camera techniques, and sound immersion, Sissako paints an intricate depiction of Middle Eastern life and the ways conflict is resolved. The film jumps between multiple narratives as it follows the central story of a herdsman named Kidane and his lost cow. It begins with a small truck filled with Islamic fighters chasing after a gazelle, which seems to set the stage for how the rest of the movie will follow, hinting at themes of fear, control, and death. The audience is introduced to the town and its new militant inhabitants, and the jihadists have completely upended the normal way of living by enacting strict new rules, speaking different languages, and patrolling the area with large assault rifles at the ready. Early on, the audience gets a sense that the town is in conflict between the old way of life versus the new, and one of the first scenes depicts a man who is stopped by the jihadists for the length of his pants. He explains that all of his pants are this length and is forced to remove them. This early scene of conflict between the old way of life and the new is resolved relatively calmly, but as the movie progresses, the response to conflict only seems to escalate. A later scene shows a woman receiving public lashings for breaking the rule against making music. The harsh punishment she receives for such a small infraction is met with her defiance, as she sings whilst being beaten. The main plot line follows Kidane and his family, who are introduced as outsiders living on the edge of town away from the new rules of the governing body. Their way of life seems safe from the jihadists, but as tensions rise among the townspeople, conflict is bound to come their way. The film explores themes of fear, control, and resolution through multiple narratives, introducing the audience to the town and its new militant inhabitants.
