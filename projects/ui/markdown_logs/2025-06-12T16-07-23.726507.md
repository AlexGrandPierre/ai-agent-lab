### Response
**Summary of the Document (Bulleted):**  
1. The document focuses on digital privilege and its implications for social media algorithms' shape in how we think, spend our days and what ways to harm users based on four different factors namely Social Deprivation, Sleep Deprivation, Attention Fragmentation & Addiction. 
2. It then concludes by discussing the impact of these harmful practices upon user experience: up first is social deprivation leading towards a flat interface (scroll but feel alone), next comes sleep deprivation where we sit and lose focus in twilight feeds, attention fragmentation bouncing thought to lossing focus post-to-post which leads into Addiction.
3. The document then provides details on how users respond based upon these factors leading us towards Homogenization vs Hyper Fragmentation of media using ageism (race lead), sexism and etc in terms related data bias, homogeneity or hyper fragmentation as the difference between them leads to different outcomes but has more accountability.
4. Finally, it gives an overview about how algorithms can be sorted by demographic data leading us towards 'Age-based isms' (sorting based on age) and a case of sorting media items according color or hair colour for prejudice with the use of race lead as in terms related to sexism.
5. The document concludes stating that there has been another lawsuit since we’ve updated over air, implying an alternative perspective is out-of-date and needs updating accordingly due to data bias & privacy concerns are prevalent all around us today which leads towards a new era of social media algorithms' shape analysis in terms related user experience.
